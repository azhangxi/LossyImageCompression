# LossyImageCompression
#Overview
The inspiration for this assignment came from an article about an artist whose work recreates classic portraits with a blocky effect.
The exact algorithm he used is not given in the article, but we will create similar images using a strategy for image representation
that underlies common lossy image compression algorithms.
The two images below illustrate the result of this assignment. Note that the second image sacrifices color detail in rectangles that 
do not contain much color variability in the original image, but maintains detail by using smaller rectangles in areas of the original
image containing lots of variability.
